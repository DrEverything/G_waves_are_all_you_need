I have to start by saying there’s a high chance I am stretching some definitions beyond their standard usage, because I honestly don’t know where the official boundaries are. I often take a concept and push it toward its "philosophical" limit, rather than sticking to the boxed definition.

I’m probably not being clear enough in a lot of places. Please, if something seems unclear or even obviously wrong, ask me to clarify what I mean.

I'm not claiming this paper is the final answer. Maybe even the gravitational waves I describe are emergent too. What I'm doing is proposing a way to think: start from the fewest possible assumptions, and only add more if you absolutely have to. This is not meant to take you to the final destination. It's just meant to point the way and to make the search more efficient.

Think about it: instead of starting with many separate things that kind of fit together and trying to unify them later, why not start with nothing but a framework that already assumes unity from the start?

One approach starts from the top; the other starts from the bottom. Hopefully they meet in the middle.

Because it challenges standard assumptions about causality in gravity and matter, and offers a new bottom-up framework.

Physical Review D’s focus is on fundamental questions, right?
