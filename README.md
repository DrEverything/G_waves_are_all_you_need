# Gravitational Waves Are All You Need  
## A Causal Reversal of Gravity and Matter

What if we've had the cause and effect of gravity backwards this whole time?

This paper proposes that **spacetime curvature doesn't come from matter â€” matter comes from spacetime curvature.**  
Gravitational waves aren't just a side effect â€” they're the main act. Matter, energy, and everything we observe might just be stable interference patterns within the dynamic fabric of space itself.

Instead of adding complexity, this model removes assumptions â€” no new particles, no extra dimensions â€” just space and waves.  
Simple rules. Big consequences.

ðŸ§  Think:  
- Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, but on a cosmic level  
- Matter as wave resonance  
- Dark matter as a parallel wave ecosystem  
- Radioactivity as a mismatch in local wave pressure
